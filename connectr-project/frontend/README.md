# Connectr Project

## Overview
Connectr is a full-stack application that consists of a backend built with Express and a frontend developed using React. This project aims to provide a seamless connection experience for users.

## Frontend
The frontend of the application is located in the `frontend` directory. It is built using React and includes components that interact with the backend API.

### Directory Structure
- **public/**: Contains static files.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the frontend application.
  - `styles.css`: Global styles for the application.
  
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - **components/**: Contains React components.
    - `App.js`: The main component that serves as the entry point for the application.
  - `index.js`: The entry point for the React application, rendering the App component.
  - `App.css`: Styles specific to the App component.

### Getting Started
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### API Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch and send data. Ensure that the backend server is running to interact with the frontend.
